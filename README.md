# Understanding VPNs for Privacy and Secure Communication

## Objective  
Gain hands-on experience with VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to understand how they protect privacy and enable secure communication online.

## Tools Required  
- A free VPN client such as:
  - [ProtonVPN Free Tier](https://protonvpn.com)
  - [Windscribe Free Tier](https://windscribe.com)

## Task Overview  
This task involves selecting a trustworthy free VPN service, setting it up on your device, and verifying its effectiveness in changing your IP address and encrypting your internet traffic. You will perform a live test and reflect on the benefits and limitations of VPN usage.


## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Choose a VPN Service  
- Select a reliable and free VPN such as ProtonVPN or Windscribe.
- Register for a free account using your email address.

### 2. Download and Install the VPN Client  
- Download the VPN application suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Install the application by following the setup instructions.

### 3. Connect to a VPN Server  
- Open the VPN app.
- Log in with your credentials.
- Choose a server (preferably close to your physical location for better speed).
- Click "Connect" to initiate a secure tunnel.

### 4. Verify IP Address Change  
- Before connecting, visit: [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
  - Note your current IP address.
- After connecting to the VPN, revisit the same site.
  - Confirm that your IP address reflects the VPN serverâ€™s location.

### 5. Confirm Encrypted Traffic  
- Browse secure websites (e.g., your email, bank) while connected to the VPN.
- Your data is now encrypted and tunneled securely via the VPN server.

### 6. Disconnect and Compare Performance  
- Disconnect the VPN.
- Visit [https://www.speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net) before and after VPN usage to observe performance changes.
- Revisit the IP address site to confirm return to your real IP.

### 7. Research: VPN Encryption & Privacy  
- Learn about protocols used (OpenVPN, WireGuard, etc.).
- Understand privacy benefits like masking IP, avoiding ISP throttling, and protection on public Wi-Fi.

### 8. Report Writing  
Create a summary report including:
- VPN setup steps followed
- Screenshots (if available) of connection status and IP change
- Observations on:
  - Internet speed before and after VPN use
  - Anonymity and privacy improvement
  - Any issues faced
- Reflection on when and why VPNs are useful
